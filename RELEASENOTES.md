Lots has happened since v0.4.1.


* terminology cleanup, see README.me
* target names now accepted on stdin
* logging infra cleaned up (thanks Claude 3.5 Sonnet!),  although that's very much still a work in progress
* per-job timeout as well as the preexisting global timeout
* internal restructuring


I still have more to do.
