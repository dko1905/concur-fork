progress bar which tracks --timeout?  --pbar {jobs|time} maybe?

document new features since last release

per-job vs overall timeout 
  per-job: if a job takes too long, kill it but keep processing
  overall: when we hit this absolute limit, kill everything
  

package things: nix, aqua, brew, mise.

clean up code, make it testable

TEST.


ok, multicontext design.

it seems to work but I need to test it.
  - does the return loop look OK with a global timeout?  do I get all the status I want?
  - same with per job.  is it always returning everything it can?
