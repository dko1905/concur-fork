command structure:

concur "command to run" ..list of hosts to run against...  --flags

progress bar

flags
 any vs all
 output type, default json
 timeout
 num procs, 0 for infinite. default 128.


* can I just add flags and args to a context?  is that what they're for?


next:
  focus on output formatting and cleanup
  reorg infra.go to smaller functions?
  and how the hell do I test this?
