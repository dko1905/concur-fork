todo:
=====
progress bar which tracks --timeout?  --pbar {jobs|time} maybe?

document new features since last release

package things: nix, aqua, brew, mise.

clean up code, make it testable

return errors from everything?  everything except goroutines?

TEST.


ok, multicontext design.
think it's ok but needs testing

also I want --first and --any to kill and return all other jobs
