command structure:

concur "command to run" ..list of hosts to run against...  --flags

progress bar
fix `-c 0`, which just hangs.
add knob to differentiate between --any (including non-zero return codes) and --first-successful.

flags
 any vs all
 output type, default json
 timeout
 num procs, 0 for infinite. default 128.  some flag to also say "num-cpus" somehow, or "num-cores".


* can I just add flags and args to a context?  is that what they're for?


next:
  focus on output formatting and cleanup
  reorg infra.go to smaller functions?
  and how the hell do I test this?
