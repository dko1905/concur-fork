=====
progress bar which tracks --timeout?  --pbar {jobs|time} maybe?

document new features since last release

per-job vs overall timeout 
  per-job: if a job takes too long, kill it but keep processing
  overall: when we hit this absolute limit, kill everything

package things: nix, aqua, brew, mise.

clean up code, make it testable

TEST.

come up with consistent terminology and spread it around
  arg - something internal, don't use it, shades of argv/argc.
  template - the task before substitution
  command - the fully built thing
  target - the thing we iterate over
  job - the running of a command

  "ping -c 1 {{1}}" foo bar baz

  one template, "ping -c {{{1}}}"
  three targes - foo, bar, baz
  yields three tasks - the combined string
  as each task is run it's  ajob
